## How study kotlin-android using this repository?
To use this repository, I introduce several branch strategies.
* First, master branch has only README file.
So don't click back button. Instead, please select another branch, read some codes.
* Second, branch names mean the subject of each class. You can select interesting subject likes kotlin function-lambda or class-OOP, and then fork the codes, run on your device!

## Contributes
I recommend contributing your own codes using pull request.     
**Make sure you're pulling request to branch that matches class subject.**
