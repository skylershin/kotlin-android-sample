# Play with if/else 
Hi all!
We are going to play with if/else statement. 
This statement used to control flow. 
For example, if a is greater than b then print a. or if a equals to b then print all. 

Let's create a Simple login page.
We will handle 
* a Map data structure has a some entities + How create a immutable/mutable map, What is difference between them. 
* a EditText enabled input text.
* a Button taked a click event.
* a If/Else statement for controlling flow.

##How study kotlin-android using this repository?
To use this repository, I introduce several branch strategies.
* First, master branch has only README file. 
So don't click back button. Instead, please select another branch, read some codes.
* Second, branch names mean the subject of each class. You can select interesting subject likes kotlin function-lambda or class-OOP, and then fork the codes, run on your device!

## Contributes
I recommend contributing your own codes using pull request.     
**Make sure you're pulling request to branch that matches class subject.**
